# Duel of Minds model registry
#
# Declare each GGUF file you trust locally so the llama.cpp backend can validate it
# before loading. Store weights OUTSIDE the repo (e.g. D:/ai/models/...) and add one
# [[models]] block per file with an alias, absolute path, and SHA256 checksum.
#
# Use ./scripts/New-ModelEntry.ps1 to compute and append entries automatically.
# The defaults below are illustrative; replace them with your actual models.
