# Model registry for Duel of Minds.
#
# Each entry declares a trusted model file along with its expected SHA256 checksum.
# Update this file to reflect the models installed on your machine before launching
# the llama.cpp backend. Paths may be absolute or use ~ expansion.
#
# Example:
# [[models]]
# alias = "deepseek-q5"
# path = "D:/ai/models/deepseek/deepseek-q5.gguf"
# sha256 = "0123456789abcdef..."
#
# Remove or replace the sample entry below with real model metadata.
[[models]]
alias = "sample-model"
path = "/absolute/path/to/your/model.gguf"
sha256 = "replace-with-real-sha256"
