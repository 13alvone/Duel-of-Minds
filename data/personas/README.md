# Persona Staging Area

Place custom persona prompt files here (one `.txt` per agent). Keep them concise:
- Voice & tone guidelines.
- Taboo topics or safety rails.
- Growth objective (e.g., "advance the post-1950 debates on existential humanism").

Avoid copying long copyrighted passages. Reference lawful public-domain summaries instead.
